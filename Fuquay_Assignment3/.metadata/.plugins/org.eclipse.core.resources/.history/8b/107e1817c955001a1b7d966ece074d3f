	/*
	Modify the program from Part 2 to use your question generation method to ask the student
	10 different questions. Give students only one chance at answering each question. 
	Count the number of correct and incorrect responses typed by the student. 
	After the program has asked 10 questions (and the student types 10 answers), 
	your program should calculate the percentage that are correct. If the percentage is lower 
	than 75%, display "Please ask your teacher for extra help.", then reset the program
	so another student can try it. If the percentage is 75% or higher
	, display "Congratulations, you are ready to go to the next level!", then reset 
	the program so another student can try it.
	
	Multiplication problems shall contain two numbers sampled from a
	 uniform random distribution in the range of 0 to 9 (inclusive)
	The program shall display a random positive message if the student provides a correct response
	The program shall display a random negative message if the student provides an incorrect response
	The program shall display the student's score after the student has attempted to solve 10 problems
	The student's score shall be the percentage of problems correctly solved
	The program shall display the message "Please ask your teacher for extra help." if 
	the student's score is less than 75%
	The program shall display the message "Congratulations, you are ready to go to the next level!" 
	if the student's score is greater than or equal to 75%
	The program shall ask the student if they want to solve a new problem set 
	after the score message has been displayed
	The program shall restart when the student agrees to solve a new problem set
	The program shall terminate when the student declines to solve another problem set
	Create a method called "quiz" that contains the program logic
	Create a function called "askQuestion" that prints the problem to the screen
	Create a function called "readResponse" that reads the answer from the student
	Create a function called "isAnswerCorrect" that checks to see if the student's 
	answer matches the correct answer to the problem
	Create a function called "displayCorrectResponse" that prints out the 
	response when a student enters a correct answer
	Create a function called "displayIncorrectResponse" that prints out the response 
	when a student enters an incorrect answer
	Create a function called "displayCompletionMessage" that prints out the studen't 
	score and appropriate score response
	Create a main method that runs your program by calling the "quiz" method
